# TFG_Final_Degree_Project
This repository contains my final thesis project. In this work, I explored the differences between Frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches, focusing on determining the necessary sample size for clinical research. Additionally, I developed an R-Shiny application to compare the methods studied.
