# TFG_Final_Degree_Project
This repository contains my final thesis project for the BSc in Mathematics. 

In this work, I explored the differences between Frequentist and Bayesian statistical approaches, with a focus on determining the required sample size for clinical research. Additionally, I developed an R-Shiny application to visualize and compare the methods studied.
